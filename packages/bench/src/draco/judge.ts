// DRACO M4 — LLM-judge faithfulness dimension (ADR-037 §3, dimension 4).
//
// Faithfulness asks: is the synthesis actually SUPPORTED by the sources it
// cites? This is the one dimension a regex cannot check — it needs a model.
// To keep it honest + reproducible:
//   - the judge model is PINNED per corpus version and is a model NOT used
//     anywhere in the fusion gemini (independence — a model cannot judge its
//     own work);
//   - the judge PROMPT is pinned (versioned) so a score is comparable across
//     runs on the same corpus version;
//   - the judge transport is INJECTED (same OpenRouterTransport interface as
//     the gemini), so M4 is fully offline-testable with a mock — no live key.
//
// The judge returns a single 0-1 faithfulness score per answer. NOTHING here
// runs live by default; a real judged score needs --live + OPENROUTER_API_KEY.
