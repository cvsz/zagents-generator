## What this is

**Every serious repo deserves its own agent.** A repo-aware CLI, a repo-aware coding agent, a local MCP server, memory scoped to the project, skills generated from the actual file layout, governance policy, release verification, witness-signed provenance.

`metaharness` mints those, on demand, from a GitHub URL or a blank slate. **It is not another agent framework. It is a factory for agent frameworks.**

The model is replaceable. The gemini is the product.

## What it gives you

In under 60 seconds, in your browser, with nothing leaving your machine:

- A custom AI agent gemini for your repo (or any repo)
- Recommended agents, skills, slash commands, MCP tools
- A scoped memory namespace + governance policy
- Witness-signed provenance + release gates
- Drops into Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, pi.dev, Hermes, OpenClaw, or RVM — pick one or all

Output is an npm-publishable `.zip` with **your name on it, your branding, your `npx <your-name>` CLI**.

### New

- **Score any repo before you build it.** `npx metaharness score <repo>` reads
  the repo (never runs it) and prints a one-screen report card — how well a
  gemini fits, how likely it is to build, how safe the tools are, and the
  rough **cost per run** — so you know what you'll get before scaffolding.
- **Pick the cheapest model that's good enough.** [`@metaharness/router`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metaharness/router)
  routes each request to the right model from your own results — same quality,
  far less spend. Works out of the box with zero native deps; **train it on your
  data** for a sharper fit (`npm i @metaharness/router`). Add the optional
  [`@ruvector/tiny-dancer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ruvector/tiny-dancer)
  to train a fast native model instead — same training data, no API change.
- **Let your gemini improve itself.** Every scaffold now ships with **Darwin Mode**
  ([`@metaharness/darwin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metaharness/darwin)) wired in —
  run `npm run evolve` and the gemini mutates its own config, tests each change in a
  sandbox, and keeps only what *measurably* improves. The model stays frozen; the gemini
  evolves. Safe by default (no network, no API key; pure refactor/tuning behind a safety
  gate). Validated on real **SWE-bench Lite** bug-fixing. `--no-darwin` to skip.

## Tune it to your project — then ship it as your own npm

A generated gemini is a **starting point you own**, not a fixed framework. Open
it and make it yours:

- **Keep only what your repo needs.** Delete the agents, skills, slash commands,
  and MCP servers you won't use — the scaffold ships a recommended set, but a
  payments service and a docs site want very different harnesses. A smaller,
  targeted gemini is faster, cheaper, and easier to reason about. `gemini
  doctor` / `gemini validate` keep it healthy as you trim.
- **Optimize the model routing for your work.** Swap the per-task model tiers,
  tighten the governance policy, point the memory namespace at your domain. The
  gemini is config you control, not a black box.
- **Publish it as your own package for the whole org.** Rename it, set your
  scope, and `npm publish` — now anyone on your team runs
  `npx @your-org/your-gemini` and gets the *same* repo-tuned agent. One
  command, org-wide, versioned like any other dependency. (The 19
  [`@metaharness/*`](examples-packages/) examples are exactly this pattern,
  published live.)

**Make older, cheaper models punch like frontier ones.** The right gemini
isn't a pile of extra steps bolted onto an expensive model — it's putting the
*right* model on each task and getting out of the way. Our [DRACO](packages/bench/draco/)
benchmark proves it: a small, cheap model delivers **frontier-quality** research
at roughly **one-tenth the cost**, and a smart router squeezes out the rest.
Stop paying frontier prices for work a $0.10 model does just as well.

That router ships as [`@metaharness/router`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metaharness/router)
— `route(query)` returns the cheapest model predicted to clear your quality bar,
learned from your own eval logs. `npm i @metaharness/router`.

## Try it in 30 seconds

```bash
# In the browser — zero install, nothing leaves the page
open https://ruvnet.github.io/zagents-generator/

# Or in the terminal — the same gemini (behaviourally equivalent output)
npx metaharness my-bot --template vertical:coding --host claude-code
cd my-bot && npx . --help
```

**Don't know what to pick?** Run the wizard:

```bash
npx metaharness --wizard
```

**Already have a repo you want a gemini for?**

```bash
gemini analyze-repo .                       # local — deterministic analysis only
gemini analyze-repo . --scaffold my-bot     # materialise the recommended gemini
```

No repository code is executed. Inferred build/test commands are emitted as `trust: inferred · execution: disabled`.

## Hosts

The same gemini output runs on **nine** agent hosts — eight interactive, plus GitHub Actions (CI/CD):

| Host | What ships | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [**Claude Code**](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp) | MCP server + hooks + 3-scope settings | Richest surface; Ruflo-native |
| [**OpenAI Codex**](https://developers.openai.com/codex) | MCP via `~/.codex/config.toml` | TOML, no hooks |
| [**pi.dev**](https://pi.dev/) | Pi extension via `pi.registerTool()` | No MCP by design |
| [**Hermes**](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/) | MCP runtime, `<think>` scrubbing | Per Hermes issue #741 |
| [**OpenClaw**](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) | `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` + workspace skills | Personal-AI gateway |
| [**RVM**](https://github.com/ruvnet/rvm) | Bare-metal microhypervisor + capability tokens | Hardware isolation for untrusted peers |
| [**GitHub Copilot**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/mcp) | MCP via `.vscode/mcp.json` | VSCode 1.99+ (ADR-032) |
| [**OpenCode**](https://opencode.ai/) | MCP via `.opencode/opencode.json` | sst/opencode TUI (ADR-036) |
| [**GitHub Actions**](https://docs.github.com/actions) | `.github/workflows/` + composite `action.yml` | **Non-interactive** CI/CD; default-deny via `permissions:` (ADR-033) |

See [ADR-004 — Host integration model](docs/adrs/ADR-004-host-integration-model.md) and [ADR-033 — GitHub Actions host](docs/adrs/ADR-033-host-github-actions.md).

---

## MCP — modular, default-deny

MCP is included as a first-class **adapter surface, not the identity**. It is gated and default-deny ([ADR-022](docs/adrs/ADR-022-mcp-primitive.md)):

- Modes: `off` · `local` (stdio) · `remote` (HTTPS + auth)
- Emits `src/mcp/{server,tools,resources,prompts,policy,audit}.ts` + a scannable `.gemini/mcp-policy.json`
- Safe defaults: no network, no shell, no file-write, approve-dangerous, 30s timeout, 8 calls/turn, audit on
- `gemini mcp-scan <path>` — *"npm audit for agent tools"*: static-only scan flagging shell/network grants, missing audit/timeouts, wildcard permissions, unguarded secrets, unpinned deps. Exits 1 on any HIGH.

---

## Verticals (19 quick-start templates)

```bash
npx metaharness --list
npx metaharness my-bot --template vertical:coding
```

| Category | Templates |
|---|---|
| Starter / Operations | `minimal`, `vertical:devops` |
| Engineering | `vertical:coding`, `vertical:ai`, **`vertical:repo-maintainer`** (iter 113) |
| Knowledge | `vertical:research`, `vertical:ruview`, `vertical:education` |
| Finance / Pro | `vertical:trading`, `vertical:legal`, `vertical:health` |
| Customer / Growth | `vertical:support`, `vertical:crm`, `vertical:marketing`, `vertical:advertising`, `vertical:sales` |
| Business / Frontier | `vertical:business`, `vertical:agentics`, `vertical:gaming`, `vertical:exotic` |

Each ships bespoke domain agents (with system prompts), skills, commands, and per-host settings — all default-deny.

---

## One-command examples

Don't want to pick flags? Each host and vertical has a dedicated
`@metaharness/*` wrapper — **published, one `npx` away**, no template/host
flags to remember. A scaffold from a wrapper is byte-identical to the
equivalent `metaharness` invocation.

## Architecture in 30 seconds

```
You (gemini author)
   └→ zagents-generator    ← the factory
        └→ Your gemini (.zip)    ← what you ship
             ├ npx <your-name>     ← your identity
             ├ <your agents>       ← your content
             └ @metaharness/kernel       ← shared primitives (Rust + WASM + NAPI-RS)
                  └→ Host adapter (Claude Code / Codex / pi.dev / Hermes / OpenClaw / RVM)
                       └→ LLM providers
```

You operate the factory. The factory produces your gemini. Your users never see the factory — only the brand and CLI you ship. The kernel ships as `@metaharness/kernel` (Rust → wasm-pack + NAPI-RS); your content stays yours.

## Quality gates

| Concern | Where |
|---|---|
| **CI** | [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) — Rust 3-platform × fmt/clippy/test/doc + WASM build + size budget + Node 20/22 × 3-platform |
| **Publish** | [`publish.yml`](.github/workflows/publish.yml) — GCP WIF → Secret Manager → smoke → `npm publish --provenance` (SLSA L2) |
| **Security** | [`security.yml`](.github/workflows/security.yml) — cargo-audit + cargo-deny + npm-audit + CodeQL + weekly cron |
| **Provenance** | [ADR-011](docs/adrs/ADR-011-witness-and-provenance.md) — Ed25519-signed witness manifest, byte-deterministic across runners |
| **Studio liveness** | [`pages-monitor.yml`](.github/workflows/pages-monitor.yml) — daily HTTP probe of live Studio |
| **Research quality (DRACO)** | [`draco.yml`](.github/workflows/draco.yml) — cross-domain deep-research benchmark ([ADR-037](docs/adrs/ADR-037-draco-deep-research-benchmark.md)). Deterministic subset gates the scorer/runner machinery on every push (offline); a weekly judged cadence runs the real OpenRouter-fusion score. 5 dimensions (grounding/coverage/balance/cleanliness/faithfulness); the verifier + judge are different model families than the synthesizer (fusion). See [`packages/bench/draco/`](packages/bench/draco/). |

## FAQ

### What is MetaHarness?

MetaHarness is a CLI and browser Studio that turns any GitHub repo (or a
blank slate) into a custom AI agent gemini. The output is a branded,
npm-publishable package with its own `npx <name>` CLI, MCP server, memory,
governance policy, and Ed25519 witness-signed releases. Runs on Claude
Code, OpenAI Codex, pi.dev, Hermes, OpenClaw, and RVM.

### How is MetaHarness different from an agent framework?

Frameworks help **developers** build agents. MetaHarness helps
**repositories** ship agents. The model is replaceable; the gemini is
the product.

### Do I need to run a server?

No. The Studio is 100% client-side (GitHub Pages). The CLI runs locally.
There is no MetaHarness account, no hosted backend, no telemetry.

### Does it execute my code during analysis?

No. `metaharness analyze` and `metaharness genome` are deterministic
static-analysis only. Inferred build/test commands are marked
`trust: inferred · execution: disabled`.

### Which agent runtimes does it support?

Six today: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, pi.dev, Hermes (Nous Research),
OpenClaw, and RVM. GitHub Copilot and GitHub Actions are proposed in
ADR-032 and ADR-033.

### What languages does it understand?

Rust, TypeScript / JavaScript, Python, and Go are detected
deterministically via lockfile and manifest probing. Lexical scoring is
the default; optional in-browser MiniLM embeddings via Transformers.js
boost recall for unusual repos.

### Is the output really npm-publishable?

Yes — the generated gemini ships with `package.json`, `bin`, a working
CLI, and `gemini validate` to gate releases. `gemini sign` adds the
Ed25519 witness; `gemini sbom` emits SPDX-2.3.
