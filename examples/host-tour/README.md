# host-tour — scaffold + validate for every supported host

> Brought up to date in iter 128.2 — published CLI is now `metaharness`
> (`npx metaharness <name> ...`); workspace-internal imports below still
> reference the `packages/create-agent-gemini/` source path by design.

> One script, six hosts, one runnable demo of the multi-host parity story.

```bash
node examples/host-tour/host-tour.mjs

## What it demonstrates

| Layer | This script exercises |
|---|---|
| Scaffolder (iter 4) | `scaffold()` with each of the 6 hosts |
| Per-host adapter (iter 2/11/12) | Each adapter emits its own config shape |
| Validate umbrella (iter 20) | `gemini validate --skip-gcp` HEALTHY for every host |
| Per-host parity contract (iter 23/30) | The same scaffolder produces 6 valid harnesses |

If any host returns FAIL, you've found a regression that escapes the per-host e2e + validate sweep — open an issue.

## Per-host notes

| Host | Adapter package |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | [`@metaharness/host-claude-code`](../../packages/host-claude-code/) |
| OpenAI Codex | [`@metaharness/host-codex`](../../packages/host-codex/) |
| pi.dev | [`@metaharness/host-pi-dev`](../../packages/host-pi-dev/) |
| Hermes Agent | [`@metaharness/host-hermes`](../../packages/host-hermes/) |
| OpenClaw | [`@metaharness/host-openclaw`](../../packages/host-openclaw/) |
| RVM | [`@metaharness/host-rvm`](../../packages/host-rvm/) |

The `minimal` template emits a host-agnostic file shape (`CLAUDE.md` etc.) with the chosen host tagged in `manifest.hosts`. For host-specific runtime config (e.g. `.codex/config.toml`, `.openclaw/policy.yml`, `rvm-partition.toml`), the adapter packages emit those at runtime via `adapter.generateConfig(spec)` — see [`packages/bench/src/host-bench.ts`](../../packages/bench/src/host-bench.ts) for the cross-adapter benchmark that exercises `generateConfig()` directly.

## Test contract

A regression in either the scaffolder or any host adapter that prevents one host from producing a HEALTHY manifest will fail this script with exit 1. CI runs the equivalent integration test (`__tests__/e2e-scaffold-validate.test.ts` + `__tests__/e2e-lifecycle.test.ts`) on every push.
