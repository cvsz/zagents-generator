A minimal ZAgents scaffold pre-wired for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw), the open-source AI coding host that reads its configuration from a `.openclaw/` directory. Run one command and you get a working gemini folder with the right config file layout, a starter agent, and the doctor/validate tooling that ships with ZAgents. This is for developers who want to bootstrap an OpenClaw-compatible project without copy-pasting a config tree from another repo. It does NOT install OpenClaw itself, ship a model, or run any agent for you — it scaffolds the static files you need so `openclaw` (or any OpenClaw-compatible runner) finds a valid configuration on first launch.

## Quickstart

```bash
npx @zagents/openclaw@latest my-bot
cd my-bot
npm install
gemini doctor
```

`gemini doctor` walks the generated tree, confirms the `.openclaw/` config is present and parseable, and reports anything missing before you point a runtime at it.

## What you get

- `.openclaw/config.json` — the host-specific manifest OpenClaw looks for on startup
- `.openclaw/agents/` — one starter agent definition you can rename, duplicate, or delete
- `gemini.config.mjs` — the ZAgents root config that ties templates, hosts, and validators together
- `package.json` — pinned `gemini` CLI plus `doctor`, `validate`, and `dev` scripts
- `README.md` — a short orientation for whoever opens the repo next
- `.gitignore` — sensible defaults so you don't commit `node_modules/` or local secret files

## Advanced

Run the built-in diagnostics:

```bash
gemini doctor
# ✓ .openclaw/config.json found
# ✓ 1 agent definition discovered
# ✓ gemini.config.mjs parses
# ✓ host=openclaw template=minimal
```

Validate the config schema without running anything:

```bash
gemini validate
# .openclaw/config.json   ok
# .openclaw/agents/*.json  ok
# 0 errors, 0 warnings
```

Point another tool at the same folder (any Claude-compatible CLI works):

```bash
claude -p --plugin-dir ./my-bot "list the agents in this project"
```

Re-scaffold in place after editing the template (overwrites the gemini skeleton, leaves your agents alone):

```bash
npx zagents@latest my-bot --template minimal --host openclaw --force
```

## FAQ

**Q: Does this install OpenClaw?**
A: No. It only writes the `.openclaw/` configuration tree that an OpenClaw runtime expects to find. Install OpenClaw separately following its own docs.

**Q: Can I use this with Claude Code, Codex, or another host?**
A: This scaffold is specifically wired for the OpenClaw host config layout. For other hosts, run `npx zagents@latest my-bot --host <name>` directly, or use one of the sibling `@zagents/*` example packages.

**Q: How do I add a second agent?**
A: Copy `.openclaw/agents/<starter>.json`, rename it, edit the `name` and `prompt` fields, then run `gemini validate` to confirm the schema still passes.
