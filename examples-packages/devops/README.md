A ready-made multi-agent scaffold for incident response on top of Claude Code. It provisions four specialized agents — `responder`, `runbook-runner`, `escalator`, and `postmortem` — wired together with tiered model routing, project-scoped settings, and a `gemini doctor` health check. Use it to bootstrap an on-call assistant that triages alerts, executes runbooks, escalates when stuck, and writes the postmortem afterward.

This scaffold is for SREs, platform engineers, and on-call developers who want a working incident-response gemini in one command instead of assembling agents, prompts, and config by hand. It is NOT a hosted service, an alerting system, or a replacement for PagerDuty / Opsgenie / Grafana OnCall — it is the Claude Code layer that sits next to those tools.

## Quickstart

```bash
npx @zagents/devops@latest my-bot
cd my-bot && npm install && npm run doctor
```

Then launch Claude Code against the scaffold:

```bash
claude -p --plugin-dir my-bot "page: api-gateway 5xx spike, last 10m"
```

## What you get

- `agents/responder.md` — first-touch triage agent (tier: **sonnet**). Reads the alert, pulls recent logs/metrics, proposes hypotheses.
- `agents/runbook-runner.md` — executes documented runbooks step-by-step (tier: **haiku**). Cheap, deterministic, fast.
- `agents/escalator.md` — decides when human escalation is warranted and drafts the page (tier: **sonnet**).
- `agents/postmortem.md` — writes a blameless postmortem from the incident transcript (tier: **opus**).
- `.claude/settings.json` — project-scoped Claude Code config with allow-listed tools (Read, Grep, Glob, Bash for read-only commands).
- `mcp.json` — pre-wired MCP server stubs for log search and metrics queries; edit to point at your stack.
- `runbooks/` — example runbook templates the `runbook-runner` agent consumes.
- `package.json` with a `gemini` bin shim so `npm run doctor` and `npm run validate` work out of the box.

## Advanced

Run the bundled doctor to verify the scaffold is healthy:

```bash
$ npm run doctor
[gemini] node: v20.11.1  ok
[gemini] claude code: detected
[gemini] agents: 4 found (responder, runbook-runner, escalator, postmortem)
[gemini] mcp.json: 2 servers configured
[gemini] settings.json: valid
ok
```

Validate the agent frontmatter and tier assignments:

```bash
$ npm run validate
[gemini] agents/responder.md      tier=sonnet  tools=Read,Grep,Bash  ok
[gemini] agents/runbook-runner.md tier=haiku   tools=Read,Bash       ok
[gemini] agents/escalator.md      tier=sonnet  tools=Read,WebFetch   ok
[gemini] agents/postmortem.md     tier=opus    tools=Read,Write      ok
ok
```

Drive the gemini headlessly for CI or webhook integrations:

```bash
claude -p --plugin-dir my-bot --output-format json \
  "incident: redis OOMKilled in prod-us-east-1, alert id INC-4421"
```

Pipe a recent alert payload from your incident tool straight into the responder:

```bash
cat alert.json | claude -p --plugin-dir my-bot --append-system-prompt "You are the on-call responder. Start with the responder agent."
```

## FAQ

**Q: Does this replace PagerDuty / Opsgenie?**
A: No. It plugs into them. The `escalator` agent drafts the page; your existing tool delivers it. Wire the MCP server in `mcp.json` to your incident platform's API.

**Q: Can I change which model each agent uses?**
A: Yes. Edit the `model:` field in the YAML frontmatter of each `agents/*.md` file. The defaults (haiku for runbook execution, sonnet for triage, opus for postmortems) follow the 3-tier cost/latency pattern but every choice is a one-line override.

**Q: How do I add my own runbook?**
A: Drop a markdown file into `runbooks/`. The `runbook-runner` agent discovers them by glob and matches against the incident description. No registration step.
